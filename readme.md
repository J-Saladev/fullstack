Hello!

This is a project to developer a fullstack webapp with a client-server architecture to server the html file through vite to 
increase performance as well as practice handling requests through different servers. For the front end I am using Vite, VueJS, 
Bootstrap, and AJAX (to handle requests to server). For the Backend I am using ExpressJS and MYSQL2 to communicate to a mysql server.
This is my first fullstack project and It has increased my understanding significantly.

The idea of the site is to act as a webapp for a computer store to access everything they may need to handle shipping and customers.
You will find a navbar that leads you to Customers, Employees, Categories, Products, Suppliers, Shippers, and Orders (using vuejs router!)
Each page will load a vuejs component I created to dynamically render a table listing the specific records you clicked on. There is 
also full CRUD abiliy which is also controlled via the dynamically rendered table
